â€¢ [Car Insurance Quote](https://https://github.com/prashanthlalan/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects./tree/main/CarInsurance)</br>
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input and calculates a quote based on a business logic. There is also admin page that allows staff to view all quotes sent till date.
